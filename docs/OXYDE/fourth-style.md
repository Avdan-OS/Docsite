In order to make thinks feel better and more live, some elements are animated. Depending on what are you developing, there will be different animations that will fit better.
Here, some tips to make your animations look better.

**DO:**
```
> Make animations short, using gentle curves.
> Make them last betwen 0.2 and 1.5 seconds, depending on what is it.
> Be consistent. Don't make totally different animations for each menu.
```

**DON'T DO:**
```
> Use stopping cubic beizers (Like 1,0,0,1 for example, which stops in the middle.)
> Make them too bouncy
> Make elements move too fast
> Abuse from them. Not every single element needs to be animated.
