## The Implementation
### Desktop Environment
This project aims to implement AvdanOS first as a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) [Desktop Environment (DE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment), with its own Display Server, System UI, and applications.

### Linux Distribution
Current plans are to base AvdanOS on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
Moving on, the ambition would be to then package this DE and include it with an Arch ISO to make a full standalone Linux distribution.
