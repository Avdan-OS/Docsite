# Design

A couple of design guidelines for AvdanOS.

## Website Ideas

Here we have some different website ideas that are cool but yet to be implemented;

### Parallax Effect
_<u>Parallax scrolling</u>_ is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down as webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.

---

Using Apple as an example, we can see that they use the Parallax Effect heavily on their product pages;

<AutoPlay src="/vid/macbook-air.webm" />

Here's a page with some of the best parallax scrolling page: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/what-is-parallax-scrolling

A tutorial from Fireship:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UgIwjLg4ONk" title="YouTube video player" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe>

### Day & Night Mode Cycle (Auto Dark Mode)

Just like in the concept, the AvdanOS website could have an auto dark mode. We can use the `Date()` API in JavaScript to get the current time of day and change the site to either light or dark mode.

### Shader implementation

An interactive visualization of noises, data, etc.

### User agent targeted marketing

We can check the user's `user agent` to show a targeted message. User Agent detection should also be used for optimizing the download workflow. Using an API, we can understand the operating system the user is current running on their computer (and maybe use a poll) and use it to target key distinction factors between the user's OS and AvdanOS.
