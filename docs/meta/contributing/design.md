# Design

A couple of design guidelines for AvdanOS.

## Website

Here we have some different website ideas that are yet to be implemented;

### Parallax Effect
_<u>Parallax scrolling</u>_ is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down as webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.

Using Apple as an example, we can see that they use the Parallax Effect heavily on their product pages;

Here's a page with some of the best parallax scrolling page: https://www.impactplus.com/blog/what-is-parallax-scrolling

A tutorial from Fireship:

### Day & Night Mode Cycle (Auto Dark Mode)

Just like in the concept, the AvdanOS website could have an auto dark mode. We can use the `Date()` API in JavaScript to get the current time of day and change the site to either light or dark mode.
