# File Context Menu

<img src="/img/context_menu_pie.png" />

Thus, we have multiple features to implement, when it comes to the pie file context menu. 

### That is:

- **Get information** on the file ([Context menu based on the type of file](https://www.notion.so/Context-menu-based-on-the-type-of-file-622656d865b14f828466d36949417a68))
- **Share** it with others
- **Rename** the file
- **Delete** the file (moving it into the [Garbage Bin](https://www.notion.so/Garbage-Bin-d8cde2592b6041b3ad0aa214840a642f))
- **Duplicate** it (i.e. copy and paste it into the same place, while giving it a slightly different name)
- **Copy** the File
- **Pin it** to the Folder or Place itâ€™s currently in
- [**File Color Tagging** (see bottom left)](https://www.notion.so/File-Color-Tagging-see-bottom-left-f5c98edaf1b64775897dda0d176d5775)
- **Open in a new Tab**
- Just **Open the File** (new window)
