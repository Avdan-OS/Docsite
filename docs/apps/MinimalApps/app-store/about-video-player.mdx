# About AvdanOSâ€™s App Store

<img src="/img/store.png" width="100px"/>

An App Store deeply integrated into the OS that will allow users to download or delete any available apps that were added to the store and somewhat safe to use (we are all about safety here after all). 
It should also include both native and Windows app options (with Wine) like the Deepin App store.
