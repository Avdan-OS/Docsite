# About Image Viewer & Editor 

<img src="/img/image-viewer.png" width="100px"/>

This one is actually related to the Screenshot Taker, since when the widget is pressed it opens the Screenshot editor, which is a part of the Image Viewer. Anyways. Pretty standard stuff : image viewing, dates, events (groups of photos with similar stuff and similar dates)... etc.
