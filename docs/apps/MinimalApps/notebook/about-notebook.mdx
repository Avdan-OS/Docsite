Make like a **Notepad kind of thing**. Simple, yet mandatory for a good OS. Also we will **integrate it into the workflow** of the presumable student using the OS, and we will add a **transparent setting** to further better it (basically making the notes somewhat transparent to make taking notes for online classes even easier). It will be similar to OneNote and be **a part of our Office Productivity products suite**, though being simpler than OneNote to use. Integration of the **themes functionality** of the OS in the notebook app.
