# About Lale Browser

<img src="/img/lale.png" width="100px"/>


Using the open-source Gecko browser project, we will build a **custom browser with Gecko functionality** and seamless integration to the Avdan operating system, through integrated widgets, features... etc. Also the integration of the **theme's functionality** in the Browser.

## The features that this browser will present:
- Multiple tabs
- Seamlessly switch between those tabs (on top)
- Search bar that allows the users to obviously search things up in the internet 
- Favorite (saved) pages
- Recommended pages (based on the cathegories of the past different pages)
- Every page should be somehow put into a cathegory (Technology, Sports, Health… etc.)
- Switching between the different search engines available on the market (Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave… etc.)
- Change the browser’s theme, which is going to be indentical to the list of AvdanOS available themes
