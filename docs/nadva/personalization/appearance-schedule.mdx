# Appearance Schedule

import AutoPlay from "@site/src/components/media/autoplay.js";

<AutoPlay src="/vid/appearance-schedule.webm" />

## Expected Behavior

:::caution
### 🚧 Under Construction 🚧
This section of documentation is still under construction — it is not formalized and may change.
Help contribute to it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/docsite/tree/main/docs/nadva/personalization/appearance-schedule.mdx).
:::

The Appearance Scheduling feature allows users to change the active theme based on the time of day.

### Implementation
Requirements
* Nadva must be able to change the active theme smoothly.
* Nadva must occasionally check system time.
* This data must be included in the config file.

#### For Sunrise/Sunset
This feature would require the user to give their location via:
* GPS, or;
* Manually entering their location.

## Further Suggestions
:::caution
### ❔ Unofficial Feature(s) ❔
This section of documentation is a suggestion, and is not part of the original specification.

The need of these/this feature(s) is still up for debate.
:::
### Time-based background changes
A feature that allows the user to change their desktop background based on the time of day.
