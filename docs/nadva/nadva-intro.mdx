# Intro to Nadva

<Notice type="wip" url="/docs/nadva/nadva-intro.mdx" />

> 'Nadva' â€” isn't that 'Avdan' backward?


*Nadva* is AvdanOS' desktop environment which uses Wayland as its display server. Nadva is planned to be a session [Wayland compositor](https://wayland.freedesktop.org).

In Avdan's [concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXFEiw1aJTw),
you can see windows interacting in ways that can reminisce both traditional [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) window managers, and [floating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager) window managers. There are also [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_manager) window managers which lets the user switch between both tiling and floating modes.

AvdanOS has its own window manager called [just-another-window-manager](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/just-another-window-manager), which is based on KDE's window manager **KWin**. **KWin** only natively supports **floating**, but can also be used as a **tiling** window manager using scripts.
