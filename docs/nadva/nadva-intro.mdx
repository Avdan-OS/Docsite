> 'Nadva' â€” isn't that 'Avdan' backwards ? 


*Nadva* is AvdanOS' display server. Nadva is planned to be a session [Wayland compositor](https://wayland.freedesktop.org).

In Avdan's [concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXFEiw1aJTw),
you can see windows interacting in ways which can reminisce both traditional tilling window managers, and floating-window managers.
