# Intro to Navda

<Notice type="wip" url="/docs/navda/navda-intro.mdx" />

*Navda* is AvdanOS' [Wayland compositor](https://wayland.freedesktop.org).

In Avdan's [concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXFEiw1aJTw),
you can see windows interacting in ways that can reminisce both traditional [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) window managers,
and [floating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager) window managers.
