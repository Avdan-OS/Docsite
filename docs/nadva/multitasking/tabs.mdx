Help contribute to it on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/docsite/tree/main/docs/nadva/multitasking/tabs.mdx).

import AutoPlay from "@site/src/components/media/autoplay.js";

<AutoPlay src="/vid/tabs.webm" />

## Expected Behavior
Most applications will be able to be displayed as a tab.
Examples would include:
* Office applications (which uses separate windows for each document)
* Media players

## Further Suggestions
:::caution
### ‚ùî Unofficial Feature(s) ‚ùî

The need of these/this feature(s) is still up for debate.

### "Synthetic" Tab API

<AutoPlay src="/vid/synthetic-tabs.webm" />

Tabs are also a common pattern inside applications themselves.
But, if we want to display the application's tabs as AvdanOS Tabs,
we need to implement a way for the application to do so.

Types of applications that would benefit:
* Browsers
* Code Editors

#### What is a Synthetic Tab?
A synthetic tab is a tab that is not a real application, which belongs 
to a parent application.

1. A user clicks on a synthetic tab.
2. The parent application is notified.
3. The parent application will change its view, and display content.
4. The synthetic tab is marked as active.
