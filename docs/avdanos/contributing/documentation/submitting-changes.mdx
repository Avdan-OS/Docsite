# Writing Documentation

<Notice type="wip" url="/docs/avdanos/contributing/documentation/submitting-changes.mdx" />

> So, you want to write documentation? hmmm...

## 1. Create a fork
To get started, fork [our docs repo](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/docsite) on GitHub.

## 2. Clone your fork
Clone your fork to your local machine. Then, switch to the `dev` branch.

```bash title="You can use these Git commands, or alternatively, use the source control menus in your IDE."
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docsite.git
git checkout dev
```

:::tip
Make sure to keep your fork up to date with the latest changes by periodically syncing it with ours.
:::

:::caution
Our `dev` branch is for documentation that is under work in progress.
**Do not** commit your changes to the `main` branch.
:::

## 3. Make some changes
To preview your changes live on your local machine, you'll need to set up a development environment.
### 3 (a) Setting up the development environment
From here on, you'll need to have **NodeJS** and **NPM** or another suitable package manager installed.

1. First, install all the dependencies.
```bash title="Installing dependencies with NPM"
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server.
```bash
npm run start
```

Now, you should be able to edit the doc files and have them automatically reload in the browser.

### 3 (b) Writing Documentation

:::tip
If you use VS Code, you can use our snippets to help you along the way.
:::


Now it's time for the fun part: write some documentation to your fork.

Make sure to follow [our guidelines](./guidelines).


## 4. Commit and push your changes
Commit and push your changes to your fork.

## 5. Submit a pull request
Submit a pull request to our [`Avdan-OS/docsite`](https://github.com/Avdan-OS/docsite) repo.
We'll get round to reviewing your changes and if they fit our guidelines we'll merge them into the main repo.

## 6. Publication
If all goes well, your docs will eventually be live on this very site. How cool is that?
