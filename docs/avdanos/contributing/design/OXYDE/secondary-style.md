# Window deployments (aka App layouts)

To make the experience consisten, AvdanOS has 5 different deploymentes (or layouts) for apps.
![OXYDE Window deployments](Docsite/static/img/Window deployments.png)

By default, AvdanOS applies the normal one. You can choose the one that fits your app the best.
If you don't like them, don't worry. Altough we recomend using them, you can add you own design
to your program, so AvdanOS doesn't change it.
