#Keyboard shortcuts

Most people likes using shortcuts to agilize their workflow. Using key combinations to make things faster instead of using the mouse and going button per button.

_What shourtcuts would I need?_

Well, that depends completely on what are you developing, since a messagin app won't have the same shortcuts that a video editor has.
But here are a few useful shortcuts that every program should have:

```
TAB - Navigate from one button to another without a mouse.
SHIFT + TAB - Navigate from one button to another, if you gave another usage to TAB.
SPACE - Click / toggle the selected button or switch.
F10 - Open primary context menu
ESCAPE - Close the actual menu, if it is a secondary one (Dialogs, menus, etc..)
CONTROL + Z to undo, and CONTROL + Y to redo an action.
```

And here a few extra recomendations for your custom shortcuts:
Use CONTROL + any letter to make custom, easy to remember shortcuts.
Don't use ALT for shortcuts, since ALT is a highly used key by the default AvdanOS shortcuts and there may be conflicts.
