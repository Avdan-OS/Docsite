Something very important is having a set of accesibility features, to help people with extra difficulties.
AvdanOS includes it's own toggles to make it as easy to use as posible, but we recomend you to add at least these features:

> High Contrast mode
> No animations mode
> Subtitles
> Adjustable zoom levels

Just by adding these simple options you are done. They are the most used accesibility features. Creating easy to use software
that anyone can handle allows to create enriching and empowering experiences.
