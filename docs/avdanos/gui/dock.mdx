The Dock will be **rectangular with slightly rounded edges**. In addition to just the app icons, there will also be a **customizable widget** (it can be weather, mail, calendar, or your calls). There will be a **main area** (with the search and main menu) and a control area (battery, Wi-Fi connection, audio, Bluetooth, etc.)

## App Area

The App Area is pretty much what you would expect; it's just **apps being aligned in a Dock area**. You can re-arrange and change them however you want with the possibility to have them connected with separators or completely disconnected from one another.

## Main Area

This is the bar in the middle of the second photo, which is similar to the leftmost part of a Windows 10 (or 11 if you have your taskbar aligned to the left) Taskbar. The content of the bar is not limited to:
- The Main Menu Button (which would act like the Windows Start Menu)
- A Search Button (for searching for files)
- A Virtual Desktop Button (for switching Virtual Desktops)
- Summon Dynamic Widgets [Go to docs](/docs/gui/widgets)
