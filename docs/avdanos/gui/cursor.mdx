The cursor needs to be sleek and reliably adapted to the OS.

There are two different styles of cursors; black with a white contour and white with a black contour. Additionally, when choosing or selecting an object, it will turn into a pointing hand, allowing the user to have a little more accuracy while using the cursor.

Like any other OS, when the cursor chooses text or just glides over it, the cursor will turn into a text caret.
