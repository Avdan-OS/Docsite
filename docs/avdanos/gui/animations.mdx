import AutoPlay from "@site/src/components/media/autoplay.js"

We want AvdanOS to feel as sleek and as easy-to-use as possible. That's why animations are really important when it comes to creating an operating system. By showing and using animations, we can show the user how to perform actions, and important information and just make the OS feel nice to use in general.
