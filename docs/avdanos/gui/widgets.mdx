Our widgets are similar to what you see on newer versions of macOS. They allow you to see quick information on your calendar, your mail, work, etc.


### 3 types of widgets:
- The **desktop widgets** (first) are **always present**. They are pinned to the **desktop** and are added by the user in the Settings application.
- The **taskbar widgets** (second) are present on the taskbar widget menu and can be opened by left-clicking them.
- The **summoned widgets** (third) are present when you click on the widget button on the Dock (kind of like hidden widgets that are summoned to the screen).

> ðŸ§  We need to figure out how to cohesively mash them together so that they wouldn't interfere with each other (**coordinate them somehow**).
