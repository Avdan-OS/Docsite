# AvdanOS Overview

Hello and welcome to the AvdanOS Docs!

## What is AvdanOS?
## The Concept
AvdanOS is a design concept released by design YouTuber [Avdan](https://www.youtube.com/c/Avdan).

This project is an attempt to implement the features showcased in the video *Introducing AvdanOS (Concept)*:

import YTEmbed from "@site/src/components/media/youtube-embed";

## The Implementation
### Desktop Environment
This project aims to implement AvdanOS first as a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) [Desktop Environment (DE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment), with its Display Server, System UI, and applications.

### Linux Distribution
The current plans are to base AvdanOS on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
Moving on, the ambition would be to then package this DE and include it with an Arch ISO to make a full standalone Linux distribution.
