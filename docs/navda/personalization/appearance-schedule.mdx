# Appearance Schedule

import AutoPlay from "@site/src/components/media/autoplay.js";

<AutoPlay src="/vid/appearance-schedule.webm" />

## Expected Behavior

<Notice type="wip" url="/docs/navda/personalization/appearance-schedule.mdx" />

The Appearance Scheduling feature allows users to change the active theme based on the time of day.

### Implementation
Requirements
* Navda must be able to change the active theme smoothly.
* Navda must occasionally check system time.
* This data must be included in the config file.

#### For Sunrise/Sunset
This feature would require the user to give their location via:
* GPS, or;
* Manually entering their location.

## Further Suggestions
:::caution
### ❔ Unofficial Feature(s) ❔
This section of the documentation is a suggestion and is not part of the original specification.

The need for these/this feature(s) is still up for debate.
:::
### Time-based background changes
A feature that allows the user to change their desktop background based on the time of day.
