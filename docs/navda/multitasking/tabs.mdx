# Tabs

<Notice type="wip" url="/docs/navda/multitasking/tabs.mdx" />

import AutoPlay from "@site/src/components/media/autoplay.js";

<AutoPlay src="/vid/tabs.webm" />

## Expected Behavior

Most applications will be able to be displayed as a tab.
Examples would include:

- Office applications (which use separate windows for each document)
- Media players

## Further Suggestions

:::caution

### ❔ Unofficial Feature(s) ❔

This section of the documentation is a suggestion and is not part of the original specification.

The need for these/this feature(s) is still up for debate.
:::

### "Synthetic" Tab API

<AutoPlay src="/vid/synthetic-tabs.webm" />

Tabs are also a common pattern inside applications themselves.
But, if we want to display the application's tabs as AvdanOS Tabs,
we need to implement a way for the application to do so.

Types of applications that would benefit:

- Browsers
- Code Editors

#### What is a Synthetic Tab?

A synthetic tab is a tab that is not a real application and belongs
to a parent application.

1. A user clicks on a synthetic tab.
2. The parent application is notified.
3. The parent application will change its view, and display content.
4. The synthetic tab is marked as active.
