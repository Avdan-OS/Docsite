# About demo library

Here is stored all the content and are called all generation functions.

Main last layer's calls are placed in `demo.js`. All window's content is split in `CSS/JS` files, like `lale.js/lale.css` and is loaded before `demo.js`.

The best option is to create a class with info. For more info you may look through existing classes.
