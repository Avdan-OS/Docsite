# click

```js
static click = (e, target, currentTarget_f, target_f)
```

`DragAndDrop.click` is just an extended click event, that executes a function for `target` and `currentTarget`, when `currentTarget` is clicked. Rarely used. 

Example directly from demo website:
```js
win_fullsize.addEventListener("click", e => {
    DragAndDrop.click(e, `#${win.id}`, undefined, fullsize);
});
```

When you click fullscreen button on the window, it becomes bigger. 

This function just makes sometimes code faster and smaller.
