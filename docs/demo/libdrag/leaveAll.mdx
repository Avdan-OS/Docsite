# leaveAll

```js
leaveAll = e
```

`leaveAll` is used to drop all objects as if it was `leave` for every `dropList` item, but in `dragAdd` you can specify a `drop_f` function, that will be executed only in this function.

It's mostly used to drop all objects if cursor leaves page while dragging something to exclude unexpected behavior.

Example:
```js
document.body.addEventListener("mouseleave", leaveAll});
```
