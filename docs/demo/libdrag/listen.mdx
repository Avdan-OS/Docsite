# listen

```js
static listen = e
```

`DragAndDrop.listen` controls all movements iterating through `dragList`. Theoretically, it can move many objects at the same time as long as they are in `dragList`.

To drop all objects without end drop functions, you can `DragAndDrop.wipe()`, but better don't do it.

To enable dragging on a page you have to specify drag listener.

Example:
```js
window.addEventListener("mousemove", DragAndDrop.listen);
```

That's all. There should exist only one global drag listener. It can be any object, but remember, that all drag events will be possible only inside this object, so `window` is the best option.

This function also executes real-time drag functions for `currentTarget` and `target` Object every move. These functions are stored in `dragList`, which you can [get](get) with a function.
