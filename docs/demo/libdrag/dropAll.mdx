# dropAll

```js
static dropAll = e
```

`DragAndDrop.dropAll` is used to drop all objects as if it was `drop` for every `dragList` item, but in `add` you can specify a `drop_f` function, that will be executed only in that case.

It's mostly used to drop all objects if cursor leaves page while dragging something to exclude unexpected behavior.

Example:
```js
demo_body.addEventListener("mouseleave", DragAndDrop.dropAll});
```
