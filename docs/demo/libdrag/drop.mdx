# drop

```js
static drop = (e, target)
```

`DragAndDrop.drop` is executed on `mouseup` event and uses `info` to end drag.

`target` is required to catch `info` Object from `dragList`.

Example:
```js
window.addEventListener("mouseup", e => {
    DragAndDrop.drop(e, `#${target}`);
});
```

The second argument should be the same as the third in `add`.
