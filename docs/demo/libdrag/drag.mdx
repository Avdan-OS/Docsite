# drag

```js
drag = e
```

`drag` controls all movements iterating through `dragList`. Theoretically, it can move many objects at the same time as long as they are in `dragList`.

To drop all objects without end drag you can `dragList = []`

To enable dragging on a page you have to specify drag listener.

Example:
```js
window.addEventListener("mousemove", drag);
```

That's all. There should exist only one global drag listener. It can be any object, but remember, that all drag events will be possible only inside of this object, so `window` is the best option.

This function also executes while-drag functions for `currentTarget` and `target` Object. This functions are stored in `dragList`.
