# Intro to the Demo site 

Installing an OS on a computer is a great step forward with a lot of difficulties. That's why a lot of people want to test an OS to be sure, that it's what they are looking for.

[This demo website](https://avdan-os.github.io/Demo/) is created to show the advantages of AvdanOS and to give an opportunity for the community to try its light version in a browser or launch it on a PC without any preparations.

That's why the demo website should be _lightweight_, _fast_, _multifunctional_ and _fail-safe_.

In this documentation, you'll find out, how the demo website works and how you can contribute or modify it.
