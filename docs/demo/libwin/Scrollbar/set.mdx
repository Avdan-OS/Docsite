# set

```js
static set = list_l
```

`Scrollbar.set` looks for Object defined in `Scrollbar.scroll_bar` and fills dock element with a widget from `items` due to `pos` index.

It also has a `wheel` event, that refreshes the scrollbar every time it's scrolled with Shift Holden.

Example from the demo:
```js
var scroll_list = { 
	"pos" : 0,
	"items" : [
		weather_time,
		player_holder,
	]
}

Scrollbar.set(scroll_list);
```

It sets the internal widgets list with the given list to use it in `window.js` via `get` independent from the initial variable and origin.

Scrollbar scrolling just changes `pos` and recreates the scrollbar.
