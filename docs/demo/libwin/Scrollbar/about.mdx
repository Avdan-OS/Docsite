# About Scrollbar

The `Scrollbar` class is used to control the third dock element with widgets.

`set` is used to set a widget in the scrollbar and `get` is used to get the current scrollbar list.

It also has two extra variables:

1. `Appbar.scroll_bar` contains a string reference to the scrollbar element. 

Use it with `querySelector`.
