# merge

```js
static merge = (main_win, ...args)
```

`Window.merge` is used to merge some windows into a single one. If `main_win` is not a window, it will throw an `Error`.

You may mix windows with boolean flags to change tilling visibility after merging.

By default, all merged windows are visible.

Example:
```js
// Merge win1 and win2 with main_win

// win1 will be visible after merging and win2 will be hidden, but may be accessed via a tab in a top bar 
Window.merge(main_win, win1, false, win2, ...); 
```
