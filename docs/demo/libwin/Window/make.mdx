# make

```js
static make = (content, icon_src, title, extraClass, contextMenu, makeClone, addPanel = true, addResize = true, onclone = async content => {}) => {
```

`Window.make` returns a window Object, that can be added to the page. Before adding it you can modify it.

## Arguments:

<details>
<summary>Content</summary>

`content` can be any element like 
```js
var content = document.createElement("div");
```
You can modify it and send as an argument.

For more details check template sections in demo library.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Icon Source</summary>

`icon_src` is an url to the app icon.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Title</summary>

Window title.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Extra Classes</summary>

`extraClass` is an array of strings. All string will be added to the generated window as classes.
```js
["filemanager-window", "wide-window"]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Context menu</summary>

Any window may have a custom context menu. It's optional.

If there's no context menu, demo will use the default one.

Example:
```js
[
	...ContextMenu.defaultMenu,
	{
		"type" : "plain",
		"icon" : ContextIcons.download,
		"text" : "Download"
	},
	{
		"type" : "split",
	},
	{
		"type" : "plain",
		"icon" : ContextIcons.close,
		"text" : "Close"
	},
]
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Make Clone</summary>

Bool flag. It's used to clone content and add it to multiple windows. (cloning objects makes them static and drops events).

For more details check `Listener Adder`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Add Panel</summary>

Bool flag. `false` to disable topbar. It will also change window class from `window` to `static-window`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Add Resize</summary>

Bool flag. `false` to disable resizing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Listener Adder</summary>

`listenerAdder` is a function, that gets `content` (after cloning). You can modify this content and it will be applied to the generated window.

It allows to overpass cloning limitations and make windows dynamic.

</details>

Simple window example:

```js
Window.make(filemanager_content, "src/image/filemanager.jpg",  "Filemanager");
```

Adding window to the `body`:
```js
Workspace.add(Window.make(filemanager_content, "src/image/filemanager.jpg",  "Filemanager"));
```
