# unpress

```js
static unpress = (keyCode, func)
```

`Keylogger.unpress` is used to remove all actions with a key. `func` is optional but may be used to remove a certain key action.

Example;
```js
Keylogger.press(23, sayHi);

Keylogger.unpress(23);
// or if you have many actions with the same key but you want to remove only one
Keylogger.unpress(23, sayHi);
```
