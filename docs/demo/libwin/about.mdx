# About windows

Any Object can be considered as a window if it has a `win-tab`, `content-holder` and `icon-block` and all with the same `win_num_g` id number.

You can spawn embedded windows using this by calling `makeWindow` and modifying its output.

All `content-holder` Objects are in the window's `container`. This gives a tilling opportunity. 

All `icon-block` Objects are between `container` and `wl`.

All `win-tab` Objects are in the `tab-holder` inserted before the `tab-add` Object.

Dock underlines are connected with windows via `win_id` id, which is used while generation in `Appbar`. 

Every window generation means incrementing this variable (`win_id`).

`icon-block` Objects are used to show icons in insert mode. They can be blank.

`content-holder` is used to limit the content size and to give the possibility to move it in different windows.

`win-tab` is used to manipulate the window in inserted mode.
