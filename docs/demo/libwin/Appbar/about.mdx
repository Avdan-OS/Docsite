# About Appbar

`Appbar` class is used to fill the appbar and control apps in the dock.

`set` is used to set apps in the appbar and `get` is used to get the list of the current apps.

It also has two extra variables:

1. `Appbar.Split` is a variable, that holds a template for a split line.

Example: 

```js
var apps_list = [
    // some apps before the line 

	Appbar.Split,

    // some apps after the line
]
```

2. `Appbar.appbar` contains a string reference to the appbar element. 

Use it with `querySelector`.
