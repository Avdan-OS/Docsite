# Key logging

Window library also loads a keylogger, that contanins a list of holded keys.

You can add extra functionality in this way.

Example from demo (Ctrl hold check):
```js 
if (keys.includes(17)) {
	click(e, `#${content_holder.id}`, undefined, showContent)
}
else {
	click(e, `#${content_holder.id}`, hideAllContent, showContent)
}
```
