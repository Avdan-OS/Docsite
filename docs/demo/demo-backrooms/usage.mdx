# Usage

<details>
<summary>Tabs:</summary>

- double click to close
- click to change to the tab
- hold Ctrl and click to tile
- drag to swap places (content also swaps)
- drag out to recreate window
- drag out and drop in another window to add it there and tile
- drag out and drop in another window's topbar to add without tilling

Fisrt tab is unmovable, can't be closed with double click and can't be swapped with other tabs (it's the window base tab).

Tab position shows the content position, so to swap or add tilling just swap tabs. Fast and simple.

`New tab` can't be moved, can't be dragged out, but can be double clicked. After choosing an app it becomes a simple dynamic `win-tab`.
