# Drag&Drop library

That's the lowest library, that controls drag&drop events.

It manipulates directly the objects through CSS `transform`, so all transform changes can be applied only to the other elements except dragged one (may change with library upgrades).

All dragged objects are stored in `dragList` _(global array variable)_ as __Objects__ (info). More info about it is [here](../category/dragdrop-library)

`CurrentTarget` is an object, that can be impacted, and `target` is the object that's being moved. 

Example: topbar - `currentTarget`, window - `target`

Explaining simpler: `dragAdd -> drag -> leave`
