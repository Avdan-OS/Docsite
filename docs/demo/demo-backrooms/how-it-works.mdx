# Logic behind demo

Demo website is fully written from scratch using `HTML/CSS/JS`, so it's near enough to the webdriver to implement any possible feature if you're really skilled.

It has 3 main layers:
1. [Drag library](libdrag)
2. [Window library](libwin)
3. [Content generation and preparations](main-demo)

Upper layers can't use lower layers, but lower layers can call upper layers.

Let's discover, how all they work.
