# Logic behind demo

The Demo website is fully written from scratch using `HTML/CSS/JS`, so it's near enough to the webdriver to implement any possible feature if you're skilled.

It has 3 main layers:
1. [Demo library](libdemo)
2. [Window library](libwin)
3. [Drag library](libdrag)

Lower layers can't use upper layers, but upper layers can call lower layers.

All the class methods, that aren't supposed to return certain information, will return parent or expanded class.

Let's discover, how all that works.
